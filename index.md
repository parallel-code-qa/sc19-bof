## Abstract
The automation of testing is critical in software development to improve quality assurance (QA), but today 80% of testing is manual (Gartner) and $32 billion is spent annually on QA (IDC/Nelson Hall). Coding standards in automotive and cybersecurity (e.g. CWE, MISRA) provide developers with rules and recommendations to prevent faulty code patterns. The ever-increasing complexity of HPC software and hardware pushes the developers to critically reevaluate testing methods, but there is no coding standard for parallel programming yet. Our goal is to form a community interested in quality assurance and best practices for parallel programming.

## Long Description

### Goals 
The goal of this BoF is to bring together members of the HPC community interested in quality
assurance and best practices for the development of parallel software on a wide range of hardware
architectures.

### Topics
1. The HPC perspective: The importance of developing Better Scientific Software to manage the evergrowing complexity of HPC software, and the role of DevOps/CD, reusable components, etc... in increasing the quality of HPC software. 
2. The current status of coding standards in HPC: Early experiences in creating benchmark suites of rules
and recommendations to improve quality assurance and ensure best practices in developing parallel
software. DataRaceBench is a benchmark suite designed to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the
effectiveness of data race detection tools. It includes a set of OpenMP microbenchmarks with and without
data races. 
3. Coding standards as a way to facilitate Quality Assurance: Successful experiences providing software
developers with rules and recommendations to fix faulty code patterns in functional safety and
cybersecurity through coding standards like CWE and MISRA. 
4. The industry perspective: The importance of Quality Assurance and Testing in HPC, from
supercomputing centers to universities, and from startups to Fortune500 companies. 

### Relevance
Parallel programming is challenging and, thus, quality assurance and coding standards are
critical for HPC programmers, particularly for industry and novice programmers. This BoF shall leverage
the expertise of senior developers in parallel programming and record it in such a way that it can be
validated and reused by the HPC community.

### Outcome
We will collect best practices for parallel programming and derive a structured plan to develop
the first version of a coding standard. We will share this information with interested parties via a report of
the BoF. Furthermore, we will form a specialized group to continue this collection of best practices and
standardization efforts and implement means of communication for this group.
