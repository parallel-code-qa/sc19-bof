### Abstract
The automation of testing is critical in software development to improve quality assurance (QA), but today 80% of testing is manual (Gartner) and $32 billion is spent annually on QA (IDC/Nelson Hall). Coding standards in automotive and cybersecurity (e.g. CWE, MISRA) provide developers with rules and recommendations to prevent faulty code patterns. The ever-increasing complexity of HPC software and hardware pushes the developers to critically reevaluate testing methods, but there is no coding standard for parallel programming yet. Our goal is to form a community interested in quality assurance and best practices for parallel programming.
